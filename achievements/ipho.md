type: achievement

[Nepal Physics Society](https://nps.org.np/nepho/) organizes multi-stage selection procedures that assess candidates on their theoretical and practical expertise in physics. The best five individuals from among the thousands of participants will be able to compete in the prestigious [International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)](https://ipho-unofficial.org/), representing the nation.

In 2016, I was among the five students who had privilege to represent Nepal in the olympiad, held in Zurich, Switzerland. In IPhO, students compete as individuals, and must sit for intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. Although unable to claim any medal, the competition helped me boost my competence and confidence.
