[DandyHacks](https://dandyhacks-2020.devpost.com/), affiliated with the Computer Science Council at the University of Rochester is a two-day hackathon during which participants are required to submit their project within a designated theme and present their work to a panel of judges. Our team submitted the project [Drow-Z](https://devpost.com/software/drow-z) that lays the foundation for a computer-vision based drowsiness detection and alert system. It reads the feed from the vehicle's camera, and sends an alert when it detects that the driver is drowsy.
