This was a [competition](https://kathmanduchallenge.org/) organized by the Kathmandu Metropolitan City of Nepal to engage the youths in building innovative technological solutions on 4 broad themes:

- Urban Infrastructure
- Commmunity and Environment
- Metropolitan Public Administration and Management
- Municipal Community Service

I teamed up with my 4 good friends: **Ramesh Pathak**, **Barun Pandey**, **Avishekh Shrestha** and **Anish Bhusal** to develop a [Traffic Mobility Analytics Platform](/technical writing/traffic-map), a software application that automatically detected, categorized and counted the vehicles in the road. We demonstrated the prototype on a traffic video feed of 4 major junctions in Kathmandu Valley. 

It was a great pleasure and a great honor to win the **Urban Infrastructure** category.
