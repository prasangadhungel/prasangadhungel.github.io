"A Day of Code" event was a programming challenge organized by [Boston International College](https://bostoncollege.edu.np/), during which participating teams were tasked with developing an idea on a given theme and creating a prototype for their concept. Our team developed an application called "Krishi" that suggests crops suitable for cultivation based on a user's location and weather conditions. Additionally, the application provides economic viability information for the suggested crops.
