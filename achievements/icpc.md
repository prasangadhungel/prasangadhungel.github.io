title: Represented Nepal in ACM-ICPC, Dhaka regionals
type: achievement

The [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) is a highly prestigious competition for college students, where teams of three representing their respective universities work to solve complex real-world problems through algorithmic programming.

Each year, the ICPC regionals begin at local competitions among classmates to determine who may represent their university. Success at one level leads to an invitation to the next. If you succeed at the university level you get chosen for the regionals. But since Nepal doesn't have a spot for regionals, a group of students in Bangladesh called [Nepali Samaj](https://techlekh.com/nepali-samaj-programming-contest/) reserve a spot for a Nepali team in Bangladesh's regionals. To fill the spot, Nepali Samaj organizes a competition among Nepali teams. My team won the nation-wide contest and was selected to represent Nepal in the 2018 ICPC Dhaka regionals.
