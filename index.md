Hi, I am Prasanga, a Software Engineer with a passion for machine learning, particularly Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) and Explainable AI (XAI). 

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at [Naamche Inc](https://www.naamche.com) where  I'm focused on leveraging large-scale real estate data to assess investment potential in the industry. Prior to this, I was a NLP Engineer at [Diyo.AI](https://diyo.ai/). I received my undergraduate degree in computer engineering from the [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University.

## Research Imperatives

I am interested in **Machine Learning**, specifically **Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)** and **Low-resource Natural Language Processing**. Following is a list of areas that I have [conducted research](/publications.md) on or would like to work on in the near future:

- **Explainable AI (XAI):** To facilitate learning and satisfy curiosity about why certain inferences and behaviors of models are such, interpretability and explanations are crucial. I believe that interpretability will improve ML models, make them more transparent and thus trustworthy. Precisely, I am interested in model-agnostic methods to explain AI models, so that the same techniques are applicable for the interpretation of all the models. 

- **Low-resource NLP:** In resource-scarce settings like Nepal, techniques like transfer learning and self-supervised learning can be leveraged to improve natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, POS tagging, and dependency parsing. My interest in this area stems from the desire to bring powerful technologies like chatbots and voicebots – which are currently only available in resource-rich languages – to a wider audience.

- **Computer Vision in Medical Imaging:** My work on medical image segmentation at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/) has taught me that computer vision can be a great tool for helping radiologist and surgeons find lesions, tumors, and fractures. This experience has fueled my passion for using computer vision to enhance the healthcare industry.

- **Algorithm Optimization:** There are numerous exciting algorithmic and optimization challenges in various product areas. These include optimizing internal systems such as scheduling computational machines, as well as optimizing core products and user experiences through techniques like graph clustering and finding optimal paths in transportation networks. I am eager to contribute new algorithmic ideas that have the potential to impact millions of people around the world.

If you are interested in collaborating with me on any research projects or have ideas for future endeavors, please feel free to [reach out](/contact.md). I am always open to discussing new ideas and ways to work together to create something amazing.

## Projects and Research

- [**Video Compression Net** — *Undergraduate final year project*](https://github.com/tukilabs/Video-Compression-Net)

It is a Deep Learning based video compression system that minimizes the number of bits required to encode video frames while also reducing distortion. The major objective of the project was to replace the conventional components in the pipeline of video compression with their neural network equivalents.

- [**Covid-19 Emergency Chatbot**](https://chats.viber.com/covid-19emergencychatbot)

A Viber bot, with more than 1100 subscribers, that caters to Covid-related queries in Nepali and English. With the addition of custom-made components like transliteration and NER, the chatbot was created using Rasa framework.

- [**Population Simulation and Its Applications on Disease Spread**](https://github.com/prasangadhungel/POPULATION-SIMULATION-AND-ITS-APPLICATIONS-ON-DISEASE-SPREAD)

A social-interaction simulation and modeling to visualize, analyze and predict the spread of disease. The simulation was carried out for Lalitpur district using the data from Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal.

- [**Lung Lesion Segmentation**](https://github.com/PrasangaDhungel/Medical-Image-Segmentation/)

A CNN based model that operates on CT images(3D) and segments detect severity of lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The project was carried out as a part of MICCAI endorsed competition on Lung Lesion Segmentation.

- [**Drow-Z** - *Second Place in DandyHacks*](https://devpost.com/software/drow-z)

Drow-Z is a sleepiness detection and alarm system for drivers that relies on computer vision. It uses the driver’s eye aspect ratio, head’s inclination, and relative motion to detect drowsiness.

## Miscellaneous

I am a lover of literature, intellectual podcasts, and the beauty of nature. In my free time, you can find me lost in a good book, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in a thought-provoking film. But my true passion lies in the ability to convey complex ideas in a clear and accessible manner through writing. I am excited to share my thoughts and perspectives with you through this platform. Thank you for visiting!
