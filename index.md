Hi, I am Prasanga, a Software Engineer interested in Machine Learning, particularly Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) and Explainable AI (XAI). 

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at [Naamche Inc](https://www.naamche.com) where I am working on assessing real estate’s investment potential by utilizing large-scale real estate data. Prior to this, I was a NLP Engineer at [Diyo.AI](https://diyo.ai/). I completed my undergraduate in Computer Engineering from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University.

## Research Imperatives

I am interested in **Machine Learning**, particularly **Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)** and **Low-resource Natural Language Processing**. Following is a list of areas that I have [conducted research](/publications.md) on or would like to work on in the near future:

- **Explainable AI (XAI):** To facilitate learning and satisfy curiosity about why certain inferences and behaviors of models are such, interpretability and explanations are crucial. I believe that interpretability will improve ML models, make them more transparent and thus trustworthy. Precisely, I am interested in model-agnostic methods to explain AI models, so that the same techniques are applicable for the interpretation of all the models. 

- **Low-resource NLP:** In a low-resource settings like that of Nepal, where labelled data are particularly scarce, techniques like transfer-learning and self supervised learning can be tapped to ameliorate NLP components such as NER, POS-taggings, dependency parsing and many others. My interest in this subject stems from the fact that research in this area will bolster powerful technologies such as chatbots and voice-bots, which are currently only available in Anglo-European and other resource-rich languages.

- **Computer Vision in Medical Imaging:** My work on medical image segmentation at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/) has taught me that computer vision can be a great tool for helping radiologist and surgeons find lesions, tumors, and fractures. This experience greatly fueled my desire to use computer vision to enhance the healthcare industry.

- **Algorithm Optimization:** There are many exciting algorithmic and optimization challenges across different product areas. These include optimizing internal systems such as scheduling the machines that power the numerous computations, as well as optimizations that affect core products and users, from clustering large-scale graphs to finding best paths in transportation networks. I intend to contribute to the new algorithmic ideas that would eventually impact millions of people across the globe.

If you are interested in collaborating with me on any research projects or have ideas for future endeavors, please feel free to [reach out](/contact.md). I am always open to discussing new ideas and ways to work together to create something amazing.

## Notable Projects

- [**Video Compression Net** — *Undergraduate final year project*](https://github.com/tukilabs/Video-Compression-Net)

It is a Deep Learning based video compression system that minimizes the number of bits required to encode video frames while also reducing distortion. The major objective of the project was to replace the conventional components in the pipeline of video compression with their neural network equivalents.

- [**Covid-19 Emergency Chatbot**](https://chats.viber.com/covid-19emergencychatbot)

A Viber bot, with more than 1100 subscribers, that caters to Covid-related queries in Nepali and English. With the addition of custom-made components like transliteration and NER, the chatbot was created using Rasa framework.

- [**Population Simulation and Its Applications on Disease Spread**](https://github.com/prasangadhungel/POPULATION-SIMULATION-AND-ITS-APPLICATIONS-ON-DISEASE-SPREAD)

A social-interaction simulation and modeling to visualize, analyze and predict the spread of disease. The simulation was carried out for Lalitpur district using the data from Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal.

- [**Lung Lesion Segmentation**](https://github.com/PrasangaDhungel/Medical-Image-Segmentation/)

A CNN based model that operates on CT images(3D) and segments detect severity of lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The project was carried out as a part of MICCAI endorsed competition on Lung Lesion Segmentation.

- [**Drow-Z** - *Second Place in DandyHacks*](https://devpost.com/software/drow-z)

## Miscellaneous

I am a lover of literature, intellectual podcasts, and the beauty of nature. In my free time, you can find me lost in a good book, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in a thought-provoking film. But my true passion lies in the ability to convey complex ideas in a clear and accessible manner through writing. I am excited to share my thoughts and perspectives with you through this platform. Thank you for visiting!
