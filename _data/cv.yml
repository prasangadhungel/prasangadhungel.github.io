    - title: <a href="https://github.com/tukilabs/Video-Compression-Net">Video Compression Net</a>, Undergraduate final year project
      year: Nov 2019 - Oct 2020
      description:
        - It is a Deep Learning based video compression system that minimizes the number of bits required to encode video frames while also reducing distortion. The major objective of the project was to replace the conventional components in the pipeline of video compression with their neural network equivalents. The trained model equaled the compression ratio of the conventional system.
        - I was involved in designing the architecture of CNN, combining the components, devising loss functions, and training the network end-to-end.
