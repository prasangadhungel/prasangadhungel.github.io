    - title: <a href="https://github.com/prasangadhungel/Data-Pruning-with-Extrapolated-Scores">Efficient Large Scale Data Pruning with Score Extrapolation</a>, Master's Thesis
      year: Oct 2023 - Present
      description:
        - Proposed a novel framework for large-scale dataset pruning that eliminates costly full-dataset scoring. Our method extrapolates importance scores using geometric data structure (K-NN, GNNs), yielding competitive model performance with substantial end-to-end training time savings across multiple benchmarks and pruning techniques.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/tukilabs/Video-Compression-Net">Video Compression Net</a>, Undergraduate final year project
      year: Nov 2019 - Oct 2020
      description:
        - A Deep Learning based video compression system that minimizes the number of bits required to encode video frames while also reducing distortion. The major objective of the project was to replace the conventional components in the pipeline of video compression with their neural network equivalents. The trained model equaled the compression ratio of the conventional system.

      year: Jun 2021 - Oct 2021
      description:
        - A Viber bot, with more than 1100 subscribers, that caters to Covid-related queries in Nepali and English. With the addition of custom-made components like transliteration and NER, the chatbot was created using Rasa framework.
