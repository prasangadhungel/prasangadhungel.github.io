## Work

### Current

- **Data Scientist at [Naamche](https://www.naamche.com/)** (2022 - Ongoing)
  - I have been working on assessing the investment potential of real estate by utilizing large-scale real estate data. The role necessitates domain knowledge, client understanding, software engineering, data engineering, data exploration and analysis, model building, and explaining and justifying models' inference.
  - I have been part of developing an algorithm that considers different parameters pertaining to the real estate and provides a score that defines how much investable a real estate property is.


### Previous

- **NLP R&D Engineer at [Diyo.AI](https://diyo.ai/)** (2021 - 2022)
  - I worked on open domain and enterprise chatbots that could respond to queries in both English and Nepali (Devanagari as well as Roman). 
  - I also contributed to numerous Nepali NLP components such as Transliteration, Named Entity Recognition, Language detection. 

- **Computer Vision Research Intern at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/)** (2020 - 2021)
  - Developed deep learning models for COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation (3D) using CNN architectures like U-Net, DeepLabV3.
  - Participated in MICCAI endorsed competition on Lung Lesion Segmentation.

## Research Imperatives

Following my childhood fascination with the origins and functioning of "Intelligence", my interests are mostly oriented towards **Machine Learning** (ML). The following are some topics I'd like to explore in the near future:


- **Explainable AI (XAI):** To facilitate learning and satisfy curiosity about why certain inferences and behaviors of models are such, interpretability and explanations are crucial. I believe that interpretability will improve ML models, make them more transparent and thus trustworthy. Precisely, I am interested in model-agnostic methods to explain AI models, so that the same techniques are applicable for the interpretation of all the models. 

- **Low-resource NLP:** In a low-resource settings like that of Nepal, where labelled data are particularly scarce, techniques like transfer-learning and self supervised learning can be tapped to ameliorate NLP components such as NER, POS-taggings, dependency parsing and many others. My interest in this subject stems from the fact that research in this area will bolster powerful technologies such as chatbots and voice-bots, which are currently only available in Anglo-European and other resource-rich languages.

- **Computer Vision in Medical Imaging:** My work on medical image segmentation at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/) has taught me that computer vision can be a great tool for helping radiologist and surgeons find lesions, tumors, and fractures. This experience greatly fueled my desire to use computer vision to enhance the healthcare industry.

- **Algorithm Optimization:** There are many exciting algorithmic and optimization challenges across different product areas. These include optimizing internal systems such as scheduling the machines that power the numerous computations, as well as optimizations that affect core products and users, from clustering large-scale graphs to finding best paths in transportation networks. I intend to contribute to the new algorithmic ideas that would eventually impact millions of people across the globe.

## Miscellaneous

I am a lover of literature, intellectual podcasts, and the beauty of nature. In my free time, you can find me lost in a good book, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in a thought-provoking film. But my true passion lies in the ability to convey complex ideas in a clear and accessible manner through writing. I am excited to share my thoughts and perspectives with you through this platform. Thank you for visiting!
